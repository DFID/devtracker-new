# DevTracker-new repository

This is an _experimental_, _alpha_ version of a new architecture for the Development Tracker, based on a three-tier approach:

* Synchroniser app that copies data from the IATI Registry into a BaseX XML database, on a rolling schedule
* API to pull back data that you need to construct your pages
* Site that uses the data pulled back from the API.

This site is not ready for production use yet, and is very much an experimental approach.

Further details are in the [wiki](https://github.com/DFID/devtracker-new/wiki).
