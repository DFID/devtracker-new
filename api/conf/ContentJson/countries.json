		"description" : "## Afghanistan is the UK’s top foreign policy priority.\n\nThe UK’s development plan will focus on three key areas to help increase stability and tackle poverty.  The military effort needs to be matched with political progress, backed by development, if we are to see long-term peace.  The civilian effort is focussed on supporting the Government of Afghanistan to stand on its own two feet.  The plan marks an intensifying of DFID’s effort on the ground and will focus on three key areas; improving security and political stability, stimulating the economy, and helping the Afghan Government deliver basic services.\n\n## Context\n\nSituated at the cross-roads of the Middle East, China and central and southern Asia, Afghanistan was once the prosperous hub of one of the world's most important trade routes. But today, following 30 years of conflict it is one of the poorest countries in the world. A third of the population lives on less than sixty pence a day, one in six children die before their fifth birthday, and the average life expectancy is 44. Only one in four Afghans are able to read and write.\n\n## Progress\n\nReal progress has been made over the past few years. In 2001, under the Taliban, less than one million children attended school – almost none of them girls. Today, over five million children attend school, and more than a third are girls. Women now make up one in four of Afghanistan's teachers. Around 85% of the population now have a healthcare facility in their area, compared to under 10% in 2002.\n\nEconomic growth has been strong, with a predicted 8%  average growth this year. The economy is estimated to have grown by 22% last year on the back of good harvests. Government tax revenues exceeded $1 billion for the first time last year.\n\nThe country is now at 167 in the World Bank Doing Business Rankings, and doing business has gradually become easier since 2006. Opium cultivation is declining and the country as a whole is becoming less dependent on growing poppies, which now constitute just 5% of the size of the legal economy.\n\nThere is still much more to do in development terms, but the country is making progress."

The economy depends mainly on tourism and offshore banking, both of which are vulnerable to shocks such as an economic crisis or natural disaster.\n\nIn total, DFID has allocated £75 million for the Caribbean from 2011 until 2015. As part of this, Antigua and Barbuda will benefit from our regional programmes to help the Caribbean prepare and reduce the risk from climate change and disasters. Most people in the Caribbean live close to the coast, vulnerable to the threats of storms, flooding and rising sea levels. UK aid will provide training at community level through the Red Cross in Antigua, as well as practical measures such as safer buildings, improved water management and early warning systems. We are also developing affordable insurance for small businesses and farmers to protect their assets and livelihoods when disaster strikes.  \"\n\nWe are helping governments in the Caribbean region to plan ahead for possible disasters and integrate risk reduction into their policy and investment decisions.  Knowing what problems they face will make it easier for them to make a case for action, mobilise resources to scale up their efforts and ensure development gains are not lost.\n\nIn line with its aim of reducing poverty, DFID is also contributing from its regional budget to three major programmes designed to create jobs and increase exports across the Caribbean:\n\n£10 million for the COMPETE Caribbean scheme, delivered jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency, which will reduce red tape, streamline regulation, and help local firms break into new markets\n\n£10 million for CARTFund, a special fund to help Caribbean countries and their own regional integration initiative, CSME (the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) take advantage of a trade deal with the European Union.  CARTFund helps in testing for product standards and provides support to the tourism, speciality foods and accounting sectors\n\n£4 million contribution to CARTAC, the IMF regional technical assistance mission. This provides advice and training for all English-speaking countries in macroeconomic management, monetary and taxation policy, statistics and debt management.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, COMPETE is financing the cost of a plan to make the private sector more competitive. It is also making trade easier through customs reforms, and is encouraging private sector development by reducing the cost and time to pay taxes. Under CARTFund, we are helping public agencies put legislation in place to implement the trade agreement with Europe, as well as helping the private sector to understand the agreement so that they can capitalise on opportunities to export more to Europe and get more investment\n\nThe Antigua and Barbuda financial sector also benefits from DFID's £600,000 contribution to the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, to help it regulate the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union. \n\nAntigua and Barbuda is heavily indebted, a situation which grew worse in the 2008 financial crisis. Since 1997, DFID has provided £1.69 million in debt relief under the UK's Commonwealth Debt Initiative.\n\nIn common with the rest of the Caribbean, Antigua and Barbuda suffers from the effects of organised crime. We are training and equipping law enforcement agencies, courts and special intelligence units across the Eastern Caribbean to investigate organised crime, confiscate criminal assets and reduce money laundering.\n\nThe UK also contributes to multilateral organisations that carry out a wide range of projects and programmes in the Caribbean. In 2010, UK contributions that benefited Antigua and Barbuda amounted to £476,000."

Brazil has taken a wider role on global security and already plays a strong stabilisation role in the Latin American region.\n\nBrazil is on course for achieving the MDGs. It has lifted nearly 20 million Brazilians out of poverty in the last decade and its famed Condition Cash Transfer programme Bolsa Familia benefits a quarter of Brazil’s population making it one of the most effective social programmes of its kind.\n\nDFID is working in partnership with Brazil to promote development and poverty reduction globally. DFID has no programme inside Brazil itself.  Together we aim to have a positive impact on global issues such as growth and trade, conflict and security, climate change and sustainable development.  We focus on areas where Brazil has strong domestic experience and expertise which is well matched to in-country demand.  We are also working to strengthen our partnership with Brazil to shape and deliver the development agenda in international processes - in the G20, Doha and the UN.  Working in partnership with Brazil on its distinctive south-south approach to development cooperation has real potential to open up different routes to address development challenges and opportunities for impact.\n\nIts domestic success in poverty reduction, food security, maternal and child health, social protection, low carbon development and climate change mitigation, as well as its methods to achieve results make Brazil a highly credible development partner.  As a result, its skills are in demand from other developing countries which face similar problems.\n\nIn addition, Brazil’s natural resources and the ecosystem services they provide (tropical forest, arable land, freshwater, agricultural products) are globally significant.\n\nBrazil has the potential to promote a much cleaner, more sustainable model of development to low income countries (LICs) than that offered by traditional donors, providing real experience on ways that LICs can minimise the environmental impact of their growth.\n\nSo what is Brazil doing to meet demands for its experience? It is keen to help and sees development cooperation as an important element of its growing global profile.  But it does not want simply to be part of a traditional donor \"club\". It prides itself on promoting a distinctive model of \"horizontal\" partnership through solidarity, based on equal south-south partnerships."

Our relationship with China will now identify ways in which both countries can work together as partners on shared global development objectives on global public goods and poverty reduction.\n\n## UK-China Global Development Partnership Programme (GDPP)\n\nIn line with the China-UK ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership’, and in order to strengthen further their cooperation, and their common objective to work as ‘Partners for Growth’, the UK and Chinese Governments have agreed to explore practical means by which they can work collaboratively to achieve their common international development objectives to reduce poverty and achieve the MDGs.  To this end, in June 2011, the UK’s Foreign Secretary, William Hague, and China’s Minister for Commerce, Chen Deming, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The framework for cooperation outlined in the MOU highlights 2 strategic objectives:\n\n1. To work together to achieve shared objectives on ‘global development’, particularly ‘global public goods’, which are of wider benefit to global poverty reduction.\n2. To work together for development in other developing countries - where all participants are supportive, and where the development and poverty reduction objectives of the participants coincide.\n\nThe MOU also provides for an ‘International Development Dialogue’ to review progress on an annual basis.\"\n\n## Key sectors and programmes\n\nUnder the GDPP, DFID and representatives from the Chinese Governments and other key institutions are working together to develop a suite of innovative programmes and dialogues. Components of some of these programmes may include pilots with third countries if and when a third country requests it and consensus is reached between all relevant parties.\"\n\n## The following programmes are under development:\n\n__Agriculture and food security__ - To accelerate transfer of agricultural technologies and information to developing countries. Combining the best practice in China and UK, the aim is to improve food security through production increase in low-income countries in Africa and Asia, through three areas of work: technology transfer through demonstrations and piloting activities; collaborative research to enhance agricultural innovation in low income countries; and sharing of innovative solutions to food security challenges with policy makers and agricultural practitioners.\n\n__Disaster Risk Reduction__ - A programme that aims to improve regional cooperation on community based disaster management.\n\n__Global health__ – To strengthen the effectiveness of China’s and the UK’s contribution to global health policy and outcomes, in line with international evidence based practice. The programme will aim, among other things, to build capacity for DFID and Low Income Countries (LICs) to learn lessons from China’s unparalleled success in decreasing infant, child and maternal mortality rates and from China’s recent health sector reform programme. The capacity built and lessons learned will contribute to the development of pilot partnerships between China and LICs to strengthen health systems and improve health outcomes.\"\n\nFuture programmes may include climate change, peacekeeping, sustainable natural resource management, water resources and outward investment and economic growth."

We continue to support Haiti through our contributions to agencies like the United Nations, European Union and World Bank. Our share of their commitments is about £70 million in 2012 (including UN peacekeeping operations).  We have also allocated nearly £3 million to make sure reconstruction reduces future disaster risks. This includes £1 million through the Pan American Health Organisation and the Global Fund for Disaster Risk Reduction, to help the Haitian Government ensure that new hospitals and health facilities are resilient to future disasters.\n\nIn January 2010, a major earthquake devastated the capital, Port-au-Prince. Around 222,000 people died, and more than 300,000 were seriously injured; 1.5 million people needed emergency shelter and over 190,000 buildings were destroyed or damaged beyond repair.  DFID provided support immediately after the earthquake and again in late 2010 to fight cholera.

In total, DFID has allocated £75 million for the Caribbean from 2011 until 2015.  This includes direct support for Jamaica, as well as programmes that benefit the whole region.\n\nJamaica is very heavily indebted. Since 1998, DFID has provided over £66 million in debt relief to Jamaica, as well as over £1 million of training and other support to improve debt management by the Government of Jamaica. This meant that Jamaica paid considerably less in interest payments last year.  The UK also contributes to multilateral organisations that carry out a wide range of projects and programmes in the Caribbean. In 2010, UK contributions that benefited Jamaica amounted to £2,614,000.\n\nWith few opportunities, and unemployment in these communities as high as 38%, many young men feel that joining a gang and entering a life of crime is the only option. Through our £7.5 million contribution to the Citizen Security and Justice Programme, in partnership with the Inter-American Development Bank, we are helping to transform 50 of Jamaica's most violent criminally-controlled communities into normal neighbourhoods.\n\nJamaica's inner cities are amongst the most violent in the world - with many communities controlled by criminals rather than the state. Everyday services, like reliable water supplies, rubbish collection and sanitation are not regularly provided, so people have no choice but to rely on criminal gangs to provide their basic services.\n\nOver the next four years, 142,000 people will gain a reliable water supply and have their rubbish collected by the state, instead of depending on local gang leaders. We will help provide training and legitimate employment opportunities for at least 13,000 people.\n\nIn Jamaica, many police officers have been involved in violent or organised crime. This has resulted in a vicious cycle of worsening crime, and  people are reluctant to co-operate with the police. We recently completed a £3.7 million programme of support to the Jamaica Constabulary Force that has helped to change the culture of the police force. Police officers know that there is zero tolerance of corruption from now on – their careers depend on it. Since 2008, around 300 officers have been arrested for corruption, and a further 250 have been dismissed. Over time, this will mean a safer Jamaica. A new £7.5 million programme to improve police efficiency and accountability started in March 2012.\n\nJamaica will also benefit from our regional programmes to help the Caribbean prepare for and reduce the risk from climate change and disasters. Most people in the Caribbean live close to the coast, vulnerable to storms, flooding and rising sea levels. DFID is helping people to be better prepared and equipped to withstand these threats. UK aid will provide training at community level by the Red Cross in Jamaica, as well as practical measures such as safer buildings, improved water management and early warning systems. We are also developing affordable insurance for small businesses and farmers, to protect their assets and livelihoods when disaster strikes.\n\nBeing prepared is critical to reducing damage from disasters. We are helping Jamaica and other countries in the Caribbean plan ahead for possible disasters and integrate risk reduction into their policy and investment decisions, for example through national climate change risk atlases. DFID has also supported studies to assess the possible economic impact of climate change on the agricultural, health and tourism in Jamaica. \n\nCoastal environments are at particular risk from climate change, and we are supporting work at ten of Jamaica's marine-protected areas to protect and improve fish stocks and coral reefs. This work should provide new employment opportunities for about 3,000 local people and introduce new systems for government, fisherfolk and the local community to jointly manage marine sanctuaries.   \n\nThe UK is also a major contributor to the global Pilot Programme on Climate Change which has allocated around £40 million to develop climate resilience programmes for Jamaica and five other Caribbean countries.  \n\nIn line with its aim of reducing poverty, DFID is also contributing from its regional budget to three major programmes designed to create jobs and increase exports across the Caribbean:\n\n£10 million for the COMPETE Caribbean scheme, delivered jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency, which will reduce red tape, streamline regulation, and help local firms break into new markets\n\n£10 million for CARTFund, a special fund to help Caribbean countries and their own regional integration initiative, CSME (the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) take advantage of a trade deal with the European Union. CARTFund helps in testing for product standards and provides support to the tourism, speciality foods and accounting sectors\n\n£4 million contribution to CARTAC, the IMF regional technical assistance mission.

We are also helping the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica gain greater market access for Jamaican goods and services under CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME), as well as helping member firms to take advantage of export opportunities with the European Union.  \n\nCOMPETE is improving the effectiveness of Jamaican investment attraction programmes by implementing reforms that simplify business processes.

The sole UK funded development project in Niger has been in partnership with the French Development Agency with the aim of accelerating progress towards Education and Gender MDGs in line with the Government of Niger's (GoN) 10 year plan.\n\nThe UK will continue to respond to humanitarian emergencies, such as current ongoing work in Niger through the West African Humanitarian Response Fund. The UK will also continue to support poverty reduction in Niger through our contributions to multilateral agencies and Civil Society Organisations.

And Pakistan has had to deal with repeated crises, including floods in 2010 and 2011, and the current economic difficulties.  Entrenched poverty is denying opportunities to millions of people and undermining Pakistan's long term stability and prosperity. Tackling poverty and building a prosperous democratic Pakistan will help not only millions of poor Pakistanis, but will also improve stability in Pakistan, the region, and beyond.  That is why Pakistan is one of the UK Government's top priorities.\n\n## UK aid is helping Pakistan to:\n\n- Transform education - by supporting four million children in school, training 45,000 teachers, and help build 20,000 new classrooms;\n- Support economic stability - by helping 1.23 million people (half of them women) to access microfinance to set up their own small business and by providing vocational skills training to at least 40,000 people;\n- Save women and babies lives – the UK will prevent 3,600 mothers' deaths in childbirth and help half-a-million couples access family planning and contraception;\n- Build peace, stability, and democracy - for example, by helping another two million people (half of them women) to vote at the next general election;\"\n\nThe UK will continue to provide humanitarian assistance and rebuild schools, roads, and bridges when needed, as it did in response to the devastating floods in 2010, the earthquake in 2005, and ongoing conflict in the region bordering Afghanistan.\n\nThe UK has deep family, historic, and business ties with Pakistan. That's why we are committed to Pakistan for the long-term, to help millions of people lift themselves out of poverty, and to help Pakistan to become the stable, prosperous, democratic country it has the potential to be.\n\nIncreased aid to Pakistan is dependent on securing value for money and results, and will be linked to progress on reform, as the Government of Pakistan takes steps to build a more dynamic economy, strengthen the tax base, and tackle corruption."
